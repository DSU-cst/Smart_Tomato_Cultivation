## INTRODUCTION
Phase-02 of the project focuses on enhancing the capabilities of the system by incorporating nutrient monitoring and pest detection components.

1. Nutrient Monitoring: This aspect aims to monitor and manage the nutrient levels in the soil, specifically focusing on the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) nutrients crucial for plant growth. The system will include sensors to detect these nutrient levels in real-time. When the NPK levels fall below a predefined threshold value, the system will automatically activate a pump to supply the necessary nutrients to the soil. This real-time monitoring and automated nutrient supplementation ensure optimal nutrient availability for healthy plant growth and maximum yield.

2. Pest Detection: The pest detection component utilizes advanced technology, specifically a ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model is trained to identify common pests and diseases that affect tomato plants. The system integrates a camera module capable of capturing high-resolution images of the plants. These images are then processed by the ResNet50 model, which can accurately detect and classify pests and diseases based on visual patterns and features.

- ResNet50-based CNN Model: ResNet50 is a deep learning architecture known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. It can distinguish between various types of pests, such as aphids, whiteflies, and leaf miners, as well as common diseases like blight and wilt.

- Alert System: Upon detecting pests or diseases, the system triggers an alert mechanism to notify the user immediately. Notifications can be sent via the Blynk mobile app, email, or other communication channels, ensuring timely intervention to prevent further damage to the plants.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The challenges in modern agriculture, especially concerning tomato plants, encompass inefficient nutrient management and pest-related crop losses. Conventional methods frequently fall short in terms of precision and timely detection, resulting in diminished crop yields and compromised quality.

1. Inefficient Nutrient Management: Traditional approaches to nutrient management in tomato cultivation often rely on generalized fertilization schedules rather than precise, real-time monitoring of nutrient levels. This can lead to over-fertilization, causing nutrient imbalances and environmental pollution, or under-fertilization, resulting in nutrient deficiencies and reduced plant vigor. Inefficient nutrient management practices contribute to suboptimal growth, lower fruit quality, and decreased overall yield.

2. Pest-Related Crop Losses: Pests and diseases pose significant threats to tomato plants, affecting both yield and quality. Conventional pest management techniques may involve the indiscriminate use of pesticides, leading to environmental concerns, pesticide resistance, and potential harm to beneficial organisms. Additionally, delayed detection of pests and diseases can result in substantial crop losses before appropriate interventions are implemented.

3. Lack of Precision and Timely Detection: One of the fundamental challenges is the lack of precision and timely detection in managing nutrient levels and detecting pests and diseases. Conventional methods often rely on visual inspection or periodic soil testing, which may not capture subtle changes or early signs of nutrient deficiencies or pest infestations. This delay in detection hampers the ability to take proactive measures, leading to reactive and less effective interventions.

4. Reduced Crop Yields and Quality: The combined impact of inefficient nutrient management and pest-related losses ultimately translates into reduced crop yields and compromised quality. This not only affects the economic viability of tomato cultivation but also contributes to food insecurity and sustainability challenges in agriculture.
## PROPOSED SOLUTION
The solution for addressing the challenges in modern agriculture, specifically for tomato plants, involves integrating advanced technologies for nutrient management and pest control:

1. Automated Nutrient Delivery: The system incorporates NPK sensors that continuously monitor the nutrient levels in the soil. This real-time data is analyzed to determine if the NPK levels fall below optimal thresholds. In response, a nutrient pump system is automatically activated to deliver the required nutrients to the soil. This automated approach ensures that tomato plants receive the right amount of nutrients precisely when needed, improving growth, yield, and overall plant health.

2. Pest and Disease Detection: The solution utilizes a sophisticated ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for pest and disease detection. High-resolution images of tomato plants are captured using a camera module, and these images are processed by the CNN model. The model is trained to recognize and classify various pests, such as aphids, whiteflies, and diseases like blight and wilt. Early detection of pests and diseases enables proactive pest control measures, minimizing crop losses and maintaining plant health.

3. Enhanced Proactive Pest Control: By integrating the ResNet50-based CNN model, the system enables proactive pest control measures. Upon detecting pests or diseases, the system triggers alerts to notify farmers or gardeners promptly. These alerts allow for timely intervention, such as targeted pesticide application or cultural practices, to prevent pest infestations from spreading and causing significant damage to tomato crops. Proactive pest control measures help maintain crop productivity and reduce reliance on reactive, less effective pest management methods.

By integrating NPK sensors and a nutrient pump system for automated nutrient delivery, along with a ResNet50-based CNN model for pest and disease detection, the solution enhances precision, efficiency, and proactive measures in nutrient management and pest control for tomato cultivation.
